#  Smart Cab Rental Console

## Introduction

Since the cab rental procedure is conducting completely manually here in Sri Lanka, I decided to introduce a smart way to make it automate. Hence I implemented a working prototype for one of my project assessment in university.  Basically I wanted to have a system which supports both “taxi service” and “rent a car” options .But here I have focused only on “rent a car” option due to the given limited time duration to complete the  project.
The system contains two parts. 
1)	A physical device that is placed in the vehicle which tracks the mileage and position while uploading the real time data to a central database.  
2)	Web console for business owners to manages vehicles and payments.
